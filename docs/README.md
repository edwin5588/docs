# g2nb Technical Documentation

The [**g2nb**](https://www.g2nb.org) project integrates genomic analysis platforms with the Jupyter ecosystem, 
allowing researchers to create documents that interleave formatted text, graphics, other multimedia, executable code, 
and remote analyses, such as those hosted by [GenePattern](https://genepattern.org) or [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org), 
thereby creating a single "research narrative" that combines scientific discussion and analyses.
